I have successfully completed a Data Science internship provided by Codec Technology.
During this internship, I gained practical experience in key areas such as data analysis, 
machine learning, and model deployment. I worked on real-world datasets and implemented 
various data science techniques to derive insights and build predictive models. 
This internship has significantly enhanced my technical skills and deepened 
my understanding of data-driven decision-making.
