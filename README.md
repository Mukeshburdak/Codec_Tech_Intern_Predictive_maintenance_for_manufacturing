🏭 Predictive Maintenance for Manufacturing
📌 Goal
The goal of this project is to predict machinery failures before they occur using machine learning techniques. This helps reduce unplanned downtime, optimize maintenance schedules, and improve overall operational efficiency in manufacturing environments.

🔍 Problem Statement
Unplanned equipment failures in manufacturing can lead to:

Expensive production stoppages

Increased maintenance costs

Reduced equipment lifespan
This project leverages sensor data and machine learning to predict when machinery is likely to fail, allowing maintenance teams to take proactive actions.

📊 Dataset
The dataset contains time-series sensor readings from industrial machines, typically including:

Temperature

Pressure

Vibration

Rotation speed

Failure indicators (labels)

Note: A publicly available dataset like NASA’s turbofan engine degradation or any simulated dataset can be used.

⚙️ Techniques Used
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature Engineering (Rolling stats, lags, etc.)

Data Preprocessing (Imputation, normalization)

Machine Learning Models:

Random Forest

XGBoost

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Logistic Regression

Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC

Model Interpretability (e.g., SHAP values)
